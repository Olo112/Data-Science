# Data science:


## The goal:
    Here I place my latest data science projects, mostly with graphs. I
    might add this as my portfolio repo, so that I can put up my latest
    projects right here after I will finish with them

## My Projects:

### Sine-data:
    This is one of my beginner projects. It is easy, but it helped me to
    think more about how I could create my projects to get towards the field
    of data science;


### linear function:
    Also one of my primary projects. This project shows how mathematically linear
    functions are workng on a graph. Also, this program shows how does one of
    the best python data science tools work. Matplotlib is a great way to visualize
    data. One of the great ways are of course graphs:

        '''python
            #========================================
            #   IMPORTS:
            #========================================

            from matplotlib import pyplot as plt


            #========================================
            #   MAIN:
            #========================================

            # generating a list of data
            ls = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

            # ploting the generated list
            plt.plot(ls)

            # showing the graph
            plt.show()


            #========================================
            #   END OF FILE
            #========================================
